# Student_Data_Management

This is a student data management program which can store the data of 100 students. I made this in my initial phase of programming therefore it only uses array and basic conditional statements. I have made my code in such a way that if at any place a wrong or invalid input is given the program doesn't accept it and ask for a valid input. Also every student has to have a unique roll number.
